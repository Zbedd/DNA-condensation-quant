Big blobs of nuclei are being maintained. These need to be filtered out using a percent of median approach {cm:2025-08-16}
Validate that batch_processor is working 

Revisit nuclei filtering as needed
Figure out why nuclear density = 1 {cm:2025-08-18}
Important: write a script to validate bbbc image grouping
