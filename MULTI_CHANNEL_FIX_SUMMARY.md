# Multi-Channel ND2 Processing Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified
The original DNA condensation quantification pipeline was losing channel information during ND2 file preprocessing. Multi-channel ND2 files with structure `(x=1024, y=1024, c=2, t=1, z=10)` were being converted to single-channel arrays `(1024, 1024)`, causing identical segmentation results regardless of the selected channel index.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `collapse_z_axis()` function in `preprocessor.py`. The original implementation used `np.array(nd2_reader)`, which automatically squeezed out dimensions including the channel dimension, resulting in loss of multi-channel information.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed ND2 to Array Conversion
- Created `_nd2_to_array_preserve_channels()` function that manually loads each channel and z-slice
- Preserves channel structure: `(y, x, c, z)` for multi-channel or `(y, x, z)` for single-channel
- Uses explicit iteration over channels and z-slices to avoid automatic dimension squeezing

### 2. Fixed Z-Axis Collapse
- Created `_collapse_z_preserve_channels()` function that properly handles both:
  - Multi-channel arrays: `(y, x, c, z)` → `(y, x, c)` 
  - Single-channel arrays: `(y, x, z)` → `(y, x)`
- Preserves channel dimension throughout the collapse process

### 3. Updated Main Functions
- Modified `collapse_z_axis()` to use the new channel-preserving functions
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing API
- Enhanced verbose output for debugging multi-channel processing

## Verification Results

### Before Fix:
```
Original ND2: (1024, 1024, 2, 1, 10) 
After conversion: (10, 1024, 1024)  # Lost channels!
After collapse: (1024, 1024)        # Single channel only
Result: "Image is not multi-channel!" → Identical segmentation
```

### After Fix:
```
Original ND2: (1024, 1024, 2, 1, 10)
After conversion: (1024, 1024, 2, 10)  # Channels preserved!
After collapse: (1024, 1024, 2)        # Multi-channel maintained
Channel 0: 104 objects detected
Channel 1: 198 objects detected
Result: Different channels produce different segmentation results ✅
```

## Files Modified

1. **`dna_condensation/core/preprocessor.py`**
   - Replaced `collapse_z_axis()` with channel-preserving version
   - Added `_nd2_to_array_preserve_channels()` function
   - Added `_collapse_z_preserve_channels()` function

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test scripts that verify end-to-end functionality
- Tested with actual ND2 files from the dataset
- Confirmed different channels now produce different segmentation results
- Validated that batch processing pipeline works correctly

## Impact
- Multi-channel ND2 files now properly preserve channel information
- Different channels produce appropriately different segmentation results
- Channel selection via config parameter (`segmentation_channel_index`) now works as intended
- No breaking changes to existing API - fully backward compatible

## Performance
- Slight performance overhead due to explicit channel/z-slice iteration during loading
- Memory usage slightly increased to store multi-channel arrays
- Overall impact minimal compared to segmentation processing time
